    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This Hungarian goulash recipe is a spicy way to dress up stew beef. My mom
      made this when we were kids, and we loved it. It is spicy but not
      mouth-burning!
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be made with cheaper cuts of beef and will still turn out very
      tender. If the stew gets too thick, add a little water while cooking.
    </p>
    <p>Garnish with sour cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>3 onions, sliced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Hungarian sweet paprika</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir
        onions in oil until soft, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove onions and set them
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine paprika, 2 teaspoons salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Coat
        beef cubes in spice mixture, and cook in the onion pot until brown on
        all sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return onions to the pot with beef; pour in water, tomato paste, garlic,
        and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low.
        Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, 1 1/2 to
        2 hours.
      </li>
    </ol>
